## **JavaScript**

 Dynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use.

## **APIs**

 Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party services or your custom function.

## **Markup**

Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator.

#### BENEFITS

##### ðŸ‘‰ Better developer experience : 
- Front end developers can focus on the front end, without being tied to a monolithic architecture. This usually means quicker and more focused development

##### ðŸ‘‰ Scalability : 
- If your product suddenly goes viral and has many active users, the CDN seamlessly compensates

#### BEST PRACTICES

##### ðŸ‘‰ Content delivery network : 
- Since all the markup and assets are pre-built, they can be served via CDN. This provides better performance and easier scalability.


##### ðŸ‘‰ Atomic deploys : 
- Each deploy is a full snapshot of the site. This helps guarantee a consistent version of the site globally.

#### BEST PRACTICES

##### ðŸ‘‰ Cache invalidation : 
- Once your build is uploaded, the CDN invalidates its cache. This means that your new build is live in an instant.



##### ðŸ‘‰ Everything in version control : 
- Your codebase lives in Version Control System, such as Git. The main benefits are: change history of every file, collaborators and traceability.


---

#### BEST PRACTICES

##### ðŸ‘‰ Automated builds : 
- Your server is notified when a new build is required, typically via webhooks. Server builds the project, updates the CDNs and the site is live.
